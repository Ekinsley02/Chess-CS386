For anyone Who wants to stay informed about what matters for them, DontPanic! Is a is a free, lightweight application That helps anyone safely navigate life’s many pitfalls in a way that matters to you. Unlike CodeRED, our product is simple to use and allows the user to customize their preferences however they like.

## 3. Functional requirements (features)

- Personalization/Preferences: Being able to customize the information we receive from the app.
- Ease of Use: Simple design that is use for everyone to use and understand
- Basic Traffic Info: Most people in cities don't have many concerns in their everyday life. So basic traffic info was important for those people

## 4. Non-functional requirements
- Availability
- Usability
- Reliability
- Response Time


## 5. MVP
- The feature we plan on implementing early on would be the simple GUI and customization preferences.
- When building the GUI we try to keep in mind that anyone can use this app, so we are trying to make it very simple and intuitive.
- During our interviews, the most requested feature was being able to filter out the info they receive. If they were going to get notifications for things they didn't care about, they didn't want the app. So to deal with this we are planning on having categories, or a “tag” system to help people choose what they want to see.
