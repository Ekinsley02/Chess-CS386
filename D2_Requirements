## 4. Non-functional requirements
- Availability
- Usability
- Reliability
- Response Time


## 5. MVP
- The feature we plan on implementing early on would be the simple GUI and customization preferences.
- When building the GUI we try to keep in mind that anyone can use this app, so we are trying to make it very simple and intuitive.
- During our interviews, the most requested feature was being able to filter out the info they receive. If they were going to get notifications for things they didn't care about, they didn't want the app. So to deal with this we are planning on having categories, or a “tag” system to help people choose what they want to see.
