## 1. Description

Our system is a desktop chess application that uses a wide variety of technologies from C for the backend to Python/PyGame for the graphics to SQLite databases hosted in the cloud for data storage. The system has a graphical user interface where the user can select between pass-and-play functionality as well as some other game modes that are potentially coming soon such as cloud gaming and an AI teacher for people who don't know how to play chess.  
The system is snappy and responsive due to much of the game logic being written in C. The game runs at a consistent 60 frames per second while using minimum system resources so it can be played on slower systems without a problem.

### Script

We didnâ€™t really task the users to do anything in particular while conducting the interviews and, instead,  we just allowed them to navigate through and experience the application for themselves. We did ask the users to speak their minds when testing the program so that we could hear what they thought.

Questions to ask the user after the experience:

What did you like most about the application?
What did you least like about the application?
What would you hope for in the future?
Do you enjoy customizing your own UI?
What do you think about the AI implementation?


### Results

**Interview 1: Max Bernstien**

Interview Summary: 

While interviewing Max, he was initially really impressed with the application's design and menu design. He appreciated the clean interface and especially the background and sound effects. I gave him a brief demonstration of our chess games features and we played each other using the pass and play feature. He mentioned how he enjoyed the customization options for the board and themes. However, they also pointed out some features we lack. Specifically the lack of a social component, like a friend system or ranking ladder. Max wished we added the functionality to see friends and their stats, he didn't seem interested in playing online matches. He was not super impressed with the AI as he managed to beat it relatively quickly, we discussed some common mistakes the AI made such as trading pieces. 

**Interview 2: Nate Hunstable**

Interview Summary:

Nate Hunstable shared valuable feedback on the chess2gether application, highlighting its clean interface and smooth gameplay. He suggested adding features like move suggestions, game analysis, and tougher AI for more advanced players. Nate also expressed interest in future updates, such as better UI customization, training tools, and online multiplayer with rankings. He emphasized that personalizing the UI would make the app more engaging and recommended adding AI explanations to help players improve. His feedback provides useful ideas for making the app more functional and enjoyable.
	
**Interview 3: Drew Czesk **

Interview Summary:

During my interview with Drew, he highlighted the application's accessibility and smooth gameplay and enjoyed many of the features. He appreciated the straightforward design while also making it visually appealing. Customization was another area Drew enjoyed, as he adjusted the board and themes, he suggested expanding customization options to include brighter and more vibrant themes such as a color wheel. He noted that while the platform is functional, there are not many additional features that separate it from other chess platforms. He suggested enhancing the teacherAI may be a way to make it more engaging. Overall, Drew found the application enjoyable but sees potential for it to grow into a more personalized platform.


### Reflections

Our interviewees really appreciated the clean, responsive UI which was a recent focus point for us. People generally would like to see the AI features expanded to easier or more difficult AIs or have more information from the AI like an instruction mode. The learning curve of our system does not seem too steep for people that have played chess but chess itself can have a steep learning curve. The users performed about as well as we would expect them to, since the UI is very self explanatory and simple. The users were able to accomplish the tasks they intended, and really liked the AI in its current state and commented on how cool of a feature that was. I think our value proposition is accomplished and we also have some feedback on how to proceed on developing this further if we want to do so.
