## 1. System Description

The problem of not recognizing one’s own mistakes in chess, affects beginner and casual chess players, the impact of which can cause the player to not learn from their mistakes, which may result in the player losing interest. For casual or beginner chess players who are looking to play and learn more about chess, the UChess website is an online chess platform that allows **_users_** to not only play with friends, but also learn to improve their chess skills step by step against _Easy_,  _Medium_, and _Hard AI’s_. Unlike chess.com, our product aims to _teach_ beginners how to read the **board** and look into the future. 

UChess **_users_** go to UChess.com and will then be prompted to login using their _username_ in to the platform. There will be a menu to chose to change their settings and profile,  customize their **chessboard**, or _select a gamemode_. The **_user_** will be able to customize their **board** and **piece _color_/design** in the customization tab. When selecting a **gamemode**, the **user** can choose to either _play with a friend_, _AI_, or a _teacher_, the latter two of which have the ability to _look ahead_ one or multiple moves. When **playing with a friend**, you will have the ability to host or join a lobby which will then initialize, create, fill a **gameboard** and start a **game** between you and a _friend._ On the other hand, when **playing against AI**, you will have the choice to access an _easy, medium or hard AI_. While playing, when the **_user_** selects a piece to be _moved_, the program will send the **board** to be assessed, checking if it is a valid _position_ and displaying the **board** if valid.

### Value Proposition
“UChess is an online chess application that aims to **teach** beginner and casual chess players to avoid mistakes they are making in order to improve their overall chess strategy skills.”





## 2. Model

Our program is not object-oriented, so it is hard for us to create a class diagram. However, if it were object-oriented, this is how it would look:
