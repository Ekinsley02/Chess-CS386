## 1. System Description

The problem of not recognizing one’s own mistakes in chess, affects beginner and casual chess players, the impact of which can cause the player to not learn from their mistakes, which may result in the player losing interest. For casual or beginner chess players who are looking to play and learn more about chess, the UChess website is an online chess platform that allows **users** to not only play with friends, but also learn to improve their chess skills step by step against _Easy_,  _Medium_, and _Hard_ **AI**’s. Unlike chess.com, our product aims to **teach** beginners how to read the board and look into the future. 

UChess **users** go to UChess.com and will then be prompted to _login_ in to the platform. There will be a **menu** to chose to change their _settings_ and _profile_,  _**customize** their **chessboard**_, or _select a gamemode_. The **user** will be able to **customize** their _board and piece color/design_ in the **customization** tab. When _selecting a gamemode_, the **user** can choose to either **play online**, **AI**, or a _**teacher**_, the latter two of which have the ability to _look ahead_ one or multiple moves. When **playing online**, you will have the ability to _host or join a lobby_ which will then _initialize, create, and fill a gameboard_ and _start a game_ between you and a friend. On the other hand, when **playing against AI**, you will have the choice to _access an easy, medium or hard AI_. While playing, when the **user** _selects a piece to be moved_, the program will **send the board** to be assessed, _checking if it is a valid position_ and _displaying the board_ if valid.

### Value Proposition
“UChess is an online chess application that aims to **teach** beginner and casual chess players to avoid mistakes they are making in order to improve their overall chess strategy skills.”





## 2. Model

Our program is not object-oriented, so it is hard for us to create a class diagram. However, if it were object-oriented, this is how it would look:
