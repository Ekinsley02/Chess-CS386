## D1 Inception

## Introduction:
This project is a online/offline web based chess game, that utilizes C code for functionality and python for displaying the game. Python uses pycharm, which is a library in python that is used for game development. Python also uses the sub process library, which is how the python code will talk to my C code. Furthermore, we will be using pybag inside a web application to display the game on a web site, we will also be integrating a back end that will keep track of users stats and previous matches. The problem that our project is solving is for entertainment and educational purposes, allowing new and old players of chess to interact and play with each other in real time, in a new and different way!

## Value Proposition:
Offer a platform for learning and practicing chess, benefiting both begginers and seasoned players.

## Customer Segment:
A few people that will use our project will be casual chess players, people in chess clubs, experts, beginners, and everywhere in between!
