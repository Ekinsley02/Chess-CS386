# UChess Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We, as contributors and maintainers of UChess, are committed to fostering an open and welcoming environment. We pledge to make participation in our project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other members

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome advances
- Trolling, insulting, or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others’ private information, such as physical or electronic addresses, without permission
- Any other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Maintainers have the right to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, including issues, pull requests, and other community forums. It also applies when an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at [UchessTeam@gmail.com]. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated, resulting in a response deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project’s leadership.
